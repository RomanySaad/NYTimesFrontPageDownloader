The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com) [maintains](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014772767-Archives) a free archive of page one cover scans for every issue since their inception on September 18, 1851. Naturally I wanted to archive it.

Between its inaugural issue on September 18, 1851 and July 05, 2012, [the scans](http://www.nytimes.com/images/1969/07/21/nytfrontpage/scan.jpg) are low resolution JPG, starting on July 6, 2012 they began to provide [high resolution scans](http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf) in PDF. The script knows when to switch from one format to the other.
